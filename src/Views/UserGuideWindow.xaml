            This application helps you automate two main tasks: downloading files from your seedbox with Rclone and cleaning up old torrents from qBittorrent based on seeding rules.

            <Run FontWeight="Bold">How to Use This App:</Run>
            <LineBreak/>
            <Run>- The left panel shows your Rclone transfer jobs and the qBittorrent cleanup task.</Run>
            <LineBreak/>
            <Run>- Click "Run Now" to start a job manually.</Run>
            <LineBreak/>
            <Run>- Use the toggle switch to enable or disable the automatic schedule for a job.</Run>
            <LineBreak/>
            <Run>- The right panel (Activity Dashboard) shows a live log of what the scripts are doing.</Run>

            <Run FontWeight="Bold">What is a 'Dry Run'?</Run>
            <LineBreak/>
            The "Dry Run" checkbox for the cleanup script lets you see what files *would* be deleted without actually deleting anything. It's a safe way to test your cleanup rules.
            <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
            <Run>You can change all settings, including paths, schedules, and cleanup rules, by going to File -> Settings.</Run>
